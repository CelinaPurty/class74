 <P>Every body in the universe exerts a gravitational influence on every other body. That includes human bodies, but the force is more important between more massive bodies, such as planets and stars. 
    The gravitational force between two bodies on Earth is negligible, but not the attractive force between a body and the planet itself.
    It's the glue that prevents everything that isn't tied down from floating off into space.
    In general, two bodies exert a gravitational force on each other directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:</P>
